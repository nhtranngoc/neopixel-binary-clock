NeoPixel Binary Clock
==========================================

Using a 1M 60 LED NeoPixel Adafruit strip, DS1307 Real Time Module (RTC) and an Arduino to display binary clock.

This code, when uploaded to an Arduino, will get IC2 data from the RTC, convert it to binary, and outputs to 6 LED strings (10 LEDs each).
